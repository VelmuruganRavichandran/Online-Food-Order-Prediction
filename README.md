# Online Food Order Prediction

## Project Description

The online food delivery industry is growing rapidly, and businesses need to accurately predict customer behavior to optimize their operations. This project develops a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will order food again. The model is trained on a dataset of historical order data and predicts the likelihood of a customer ordering again based on factors such as past order history, type of food ordered, and the time of day the order was placed. The model's performance is evaluated based on its accuracy and generalization to new data. This prediction model helps online food delivery businesses identify customers more likely to reorder, enabling targeted marketing campaigns and improved customer retention strategies.
